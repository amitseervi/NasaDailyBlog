    <string name="test">If the screen flickers take effect particularly when viewing images while browsing the web, the best way around this might be resetting the NVRAM of your device. Resolving this issue involves rebooting you device. But because the NVRAM is a type of memory that saves data automatically, even when the device is forcefully switched off, this issue will not go away when you just reboot your device. To resolve this issue, switch off your Mac and then turn it back on, pressing down "Command" + "Option" + "P" + "R" keys until you hear some chimes or see the screen blinking twice during the restart. If that still doesn’t fix the flickering screen with macOS 10.14, reset the System Management Controller (SMC) as decribed below.\n\nIf the screen flickers take effect particularly when viewing images while browsing the web, the best way around this might be resetting the NVRAM of your device.
